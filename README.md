# public-scratchpad

This is a repo for stuff that is neither private nor useful/significant enough for its own repo, mostly things I want to share for some specific short-term reason without exchanging details with anybody who needs to see it. This repo and any of its contents may disappear at any time, so if something in it is useful to you, copy it to a more predictable location.
